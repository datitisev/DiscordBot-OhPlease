Oh Please (Discord Bot)
=======================

A 24/7 NodeJS Discord Bot to solve frustrating times trying to teach people how to code their own bot :wink:

Adding
----------

To add the bot to your guild is very simple. You will need to have administration permissions on the server you want to invite the bot to.
Visit [Discord oAuth2 Authorize Bot](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=209744316762030091&scope=bot&permissions=67193856), select the server, and click Authorize. I've only specified the permissions the bot needs, don't worry.

Commands
----------

The prefix of Oh Please is simply `oh please` (with a space afterwards), and I won't change it.
You can execute `oh please help` in any server with the bot online or by Private Messaging the bot.

Commands:
  * `help` - this help message
  * `invite` - invite Oh Please to your server
