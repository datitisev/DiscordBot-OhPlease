Oh Please (Discord Bot)
=======================

A 24/7 NodeJS Discord Bot to solve frustrating times trying to teach people how to code their own bot :wink:

Adding
----------

To add the bot to your guild is very simple. You will need to have administration permissions on the server you want to invite the bot to.
Visit [Discord oAuth2 Authorize Bot](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=209744316762030091&scope=bot&permissions=67193856), select the server, and click Authorize. I've only specified the permissions the bot needs, don't worry.

Commands
----------

The prefix of Oh Please is simply `oh please` (with a space afterwards), and I won't change it.
You can execute `oh please help` in any server with the bot online or by Private Messaging the bot.

Commands:
  * `help` - this help message
  * `invite` - invite Oh Please to your server
  * `info` - info about Oh Please
  * `learn js` - some links to learn javascript & node
  * `learn d.js` - two useful links for developing a bot with discord.js
  * `read docs` - read the docs of the corresponding library, if #node_eris uses Eris, otherwise defaults to d.js
  * `troubleshooting` - gives some links for troubleshooting, depend on library, eris & d.js set up
  * `show me a voice example` - sends a voice example code, depends on library, eris & d.js set up

  * `detect wrong token` - know if the token didn't work in d.js
  * `god no` - oh god please no
